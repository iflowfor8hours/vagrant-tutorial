Vagrant Tutorial
================
This is a tutorial for learning to use the basic functionality of [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and it's shell provisioner. 
The object of the tutorial is to get the two included [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) applications up and running in the vagrant VM.

Prerequisites 
============
1.  Download and install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
2.  Download and install [Vagrant 1.2.2](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.2.2) for your platform. (If you're feeling courageous, use the latest. The maintainer is pretty good about keeping things working).
3.  Configure a 'Host-only Networking' interface in Virtualbox and assign it an ip address of 10.10.10.1. Instructions can be found [here](http://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox).
